# Migrations Directory

This directory will contain database migration files generated by Doctrine.

To create a migration after modifying entities:

```powershell
php bin/console make:migration
```

To execute migrations:

```powershell
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

Migrations are automatically created when you run the setup script.
